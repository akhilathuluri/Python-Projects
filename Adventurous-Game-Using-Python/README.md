# Adventurous-Game-Using-Python


This code is a simple text-based adventure game where the user chooses a path and encounters different scenarios based on their choices. The user has 10 health points and gains or loses points based on their choices.

The game begins by asking the user for their name and age. If the user is 18 or older, they can play the game. They are then asked to choose a path, either climbing a mountain or exploring a forest. Depending on their choice, they encounter a friendly or hostile character, and either gain or lose health points.

The user then encounters a river and must choose to swim or look for a bridge. Depending on their choice, they either gain or lose health points. Next, the user encounters a fork in the road and must choose to go left or right. Depending on their choice, they either gain or lose health points.

The game continues until the user loses all their health points or reaches the end of the game. Throughout the game, the user can gain or lose points based on their choices, and these points are displayed at the end of the game.
